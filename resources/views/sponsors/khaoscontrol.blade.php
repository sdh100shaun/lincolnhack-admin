                <p>Khaos Control was created by Mike Cockfield, who had a vision of delivering powerful, high-quality, feature-rich business solutions that enabled businesses to unlock their potential.
                   Khaos Control Solutions, the company behind Khaos Control, was founded in 2000. Initially Mike forged ahead on his own, developing, selling and supporting the software himself. However, it was not long before Mike was recruiting and his first hire is still with the company today; Ben Nolan (2nd Line Support Manager).

                   The vision of delivering powerful, high-quality, feature-rich business solutions has remained at the core of the companyâ€™s values and has been the guide in the development of Khaos Control as a Multi-Channel Retail, Order and Inventory Management solution, for both Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Consumer (B2C).

                    Khaos Control Solutions have been helping businesses of all sizes manage and streamline their core processes. From stock control, multichannel order processing to integrated ICAEW accredited accounting khaos deliver solutions that help your business.

                    They have three products, which will allow you to elevate and scale your business: Khaos Control (KC), a Windows-based ERP application; Khaos Control Cloud (KCC), a browser-based ERP application; and Khaos Control Hybrid, which brings together KC, KCC & powerful eCommerce into one seamless solution.
