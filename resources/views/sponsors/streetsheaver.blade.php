                <h5 class="streetsheaver"> The Streets Heaver Challenge </h5>
                <p>Today, our lives revolve around technology and we are always on the lookout for new innovative digital solutions that will allow us to increase efficiency and live our lives to the fullest.
                    From our smartphones and wearable tech, which have apps to track our health, steps and heartrate, to virtual digital assistants found within the home which ‘listen’ to our instructions and intelligently predict our next steps, the internet landscape is exploding.
                    Add an abundance of devices including washing machines, fridge-freezers, robotic vacuum cleaners and boiler and heating systems to name a few, and the number of everyday devices and objects which share data with each other and follow our lives is phenomenal.
                </p><p>Yet, for infectious disease forecasting, data quantity, quality and timeliness persist as significant challenges.
                    We know that Forecasting is beginning to be integrated into decision-making processes for infectious disease outbreak response.
                    And that effective data collection is essential for analytics and efficient outbreak management.</p><p>
                    So, with the Metro reporting that “poo is found on every McDonald’s touch screen tested”, hotel tv remotes being contaminated with bacteria, and research suggesting that 75% of us are using our mobiles on the toilet!



                <p>Our challenge to you is…</p>

                        How can modern day technology be used to help predict/prevent an epidemic?</strong>
