                <p>ScholarPack provide an easy-to-use, feature rich management system that allows schools to make sense
                    of their data and see what’s really going on.
                    From attendance and assessments to accidents and incidents, ScholarPack helps schools record, manage
                    and review everything that’s going on. As a technology company, with a Lincoln
                    base, they actively support Digital Lincoln, Code Club and now Lincoln Hack and are often looking
                    to enhance their talented team with more development and operations staff.

                <p>The people at ScholarPack are super techy, they know stuff. They are often seen chatting about things
                    like robotics, agile methodologies, python and programming in general, they are always
                    up for some fun and lively discussion. We are super excited about their challenge. </p>
                <p>The ScholarPack  challenge this year will be:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>The Knowledge to Act</strong>
                        <p>
                            The core value of The Key Group, and the guiding principal of the Group companies (like ScholarPack) is The Knowledge to Act. As a group, we aim to give teachers, parents, governors, decision makers and school leaders the information and data they need to have The Knowledge to Act - to improve the operation of schools and the outcomes for Children.
                            With this in mind, create something that would provide the user groups identified above with more knowledge to better allow them to take meaningful actions.</p>
