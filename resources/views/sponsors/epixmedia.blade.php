                <p>The great people at Epix Media have sponsored Lincolnhack since it's inception
                 always attending, competing and they really know how to help make the hack fun, previously
                    setting challenges such as "The utterly useless hack". So they are sure to provide hackers
                    with a great challenge.
                </p>
                <p>The Epix media challenge this year will be:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>
                        The power of the collective</strong>
                    <p>The internet is the greatest tool we've ever had for communication: to share ideas and experiences. It allows people to collaborate, acting as a collective to get things done.
                        We want you to build something which harnesses the power of the collective to achieve a purpose of your choosing. How you interpret this is up to you!</p>
